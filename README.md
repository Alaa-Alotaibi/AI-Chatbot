# AI-Chatbot

**AI Chatbot Website – AI/ML, Web Development – 6 weeks**

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application that integrates an AI-powered chatbot into an interactive website. Designed and developed over the course of 6 weeks, the goal was to build a responsive, scalable, and intelligent chatbot system that can understand user queries, provide intelligent responses, and improve user engagement through a conversational interface.

The chatbot is powered by machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) models, and the application includes a user-friendly front-end and robust back-end integration.
